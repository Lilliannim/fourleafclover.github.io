The belief in their power has deep roots, shaped by folklore, mythology, and cultural tradition.

      <h4>A RARE FIND AMONG THE GREEN</h4>
      <p>To trace the origins of the four-leaf clover, we must first look to its more familiar relative: the three-leaf clover. Most clovers are part of the Trifolium repens species—commonly known as white clover. As the Latin name Trifolium implies, these plants typically have three leaflets.</p>
      <p>Every so often, a natural genetic mutation produces a fourth leaflet, giving rise to the rare four-leaf clover. The chances of discovering one are remarkably slim—roughly 1 in 5,000, though some estimates suggest the odds can be even lower depending on environmental factors.</p>
      <p>This scarcity is a key reason why four-leaf clovers have become cherished symbols of luck and fortune throughout history.</p>
